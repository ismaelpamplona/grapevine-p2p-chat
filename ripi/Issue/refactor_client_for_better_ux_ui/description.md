# refactor_client_for_better_ux_ui (Issue)

- [x] Keep the client running in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
- [x] After each message is sent, ask the user to input the peer name again.
- [x] Provide a way for the user to exit the client cleanly (e.g., typing `exit`).
- [x] Add some fun emojis
- [x] Make user prompts more clear and user-friendly.
